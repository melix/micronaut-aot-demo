## Micronaut AOT Test Application

You can try one of the following tasks to execute the application after AOT optimizations:

1. `optimizedRun` will build and run the app in JIT mode
2. `nativeOptimizedRun` will build and run a native image with AOT optimizations
3. `optimizedDockerBuild` will build a _Docker image_ with the optimized app
4. `optimizedJitJarAll` will build an executable _fat jar_ in `build/libs`
5. `optimizedDistZip` will build an optimized _distribution_
